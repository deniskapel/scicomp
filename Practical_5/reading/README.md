# Licensing

## Code

### Exercise: read the Wikipedia articles on Apache, BSD, and MIT licenses. Describe the similarities and the differences.

They all are permissive licenses with minimal restrictions on reuse and redistribution. There is only one MIT license, while BSD is a family of BSD-like licenses. Apache License has several versions. They provide high license compatibility. MIT license can be relicensed under GPL. GPL is also changing to improve its compatibibility with free software licenses (e.g. Apache License 2.0)

## Art

### Exercise: Pick a creative work (or make up a fictional one); come up with three obviously non-commercial uses of this work.

The Rosetta stone from the British Museum (free entrance)

1. Displaying in public
2. Releasesing its digitized content for research
3. Giving lectures on the history of it, etc.

### Exercise: Now argue that all three of these uses are commercial.
1. attracts audience to sell them other exhibitions
2. digital version can be used to create and sell merchandise
3. Lectures can be limitted to a certain group of people (corporate event, etc)

## Data

### Exercise: What is the effect on science reproducibility if the data set is not liberally licensed?

Other researchers will have to request this data, thus providing the data owners with an opportunity to control them in a certain way.

### Exercise: give an example of a proprietary data source; what could you do with that data if it were liberally licensed?

Certain learning platforms (e.g. Coursera) generate data that can used for learning analytics: time spent on a task, etc. There are only a few platforms that share such data, and if more of them would release at least some of their datasets, it would move learning analytics from its nascent stage towards a more mature one.
